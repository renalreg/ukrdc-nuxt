# components/icons

The icons components directory contains all reusable icon components.

Our primary icon pack is [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/). They have a Vue component library however as it only supports Vue 3, we need to re-implement any icons we want to use.

When adding a new icon, ensure you follow the structure and naming scheme of the official Vue 3 library, see [https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons#vue](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons#vue).
