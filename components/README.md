# COMPONENTS

The components directory contains your Vue.js Components.

_Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge these components._

Nuxt is set to auto-import components found here. Subdirectories determine the component's imported name, e.g.

```none
components/
  base/
      foo/
         Button.vue
```

will be auto-imported as `<BaseFooButton />`
