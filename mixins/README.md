# MIXINS

Technically not mixins in the Vue 2 Options API sense. 

Modules beginning with the `use` prefix, used by the composition API to augment component functionality. These function kind of like abstract base classes to provide foundations for components to build on.

For example, `usePagination` creates basic functionality for pages that use URL query-based pagination.
