# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project

## Developer notes

### Framework rationale

#### Vue

**As opposed to React, Angular, et al.** The choice was really between React and Vue. Vue was chosen primarily because of it's slightly lower barrier-to-entry for new contributors, and because of prior experience with the framework. Either would work fine.

#### Nuxt

**As opposed to "basic" Vue.** Nuxt is a framework based on Vue which provides a couple of useful things. Firstly, it enables partial server-side rendering, which on it's own isn't super useful, however it makes working with runtime configurations much simpler. This is useful as we move towards generalsed containers for deployment. On top of this, it provides a nice "all-in-one" solution without needing a separate server application.

Additionally, the Nuxt ecosystem has some really nice plugins such as the Nuxt-Auth plugin we use here. This greatly simplifies security implementations, making it easier to add a good authentication/authorisation layer.

Lastly, the built-in router helps further reduce the barrier-to-entry, using a filesystem based router which should be familiar to anyone who has worked with simple HTML websites previously.

#### Tailwind CSS

**As opposed to Bootstrap, UIKit, et al.** [This article by the libraries author says everything I could include here.](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/)
