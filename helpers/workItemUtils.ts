Type 9:
- Person ID always 999999999, no real incoming Person record
- WorkItem based entirely on attributes + "destination" master record
- Always an NHS/CHI/HSC destination record

Type 7:
- Always an NHS/CHI/HSC destination record
- Usually raised in a pair with a type 6
  - The type 7 is not mergable, and should be closed after the type 6 is merged

Type 6:
- Always a UKRDC destination record
- Usually raised in a pair with a type 7
  - The type 6 is mergable (both incoming and destination are UKRDC records)

Type 4:
- Always an NHS/CHI/HSC destination record
- Usually raised in a pair with a type 3
  - The type 4 is not mergable, and should be closed after the type 3 is merged

NOMENCLATURE:

I'm considering a "secondary" workitem as one in a collection of workitems raised
by the same event, which requires others in the collection to be resolved before closing.

I'm considering a "primary" workitem as one in a collection of workitems raised
by the same event, which can be resolved without the others.
